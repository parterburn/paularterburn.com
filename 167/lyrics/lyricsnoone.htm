        guy you found is the one guy I frown<br>
        its’ the one guy you know I can’t stand around<br>
        if I could go back, I wouldn’t change<br>
        and the things that you did would still be the same<br>
        from it all, long and hard</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Narrow">it made me realize just who you really are<br>
        changing your ways and looks in this phase<br>
        you began to dislike the things I would say&nbsp;<o:p>

        couldn’t help but think of it all<br>
        my world was gone – not just a year lost<br>
        and it was hard to see you<br>
        with the other guy who made sure that I knew<br>
        it took me a while and many lonely nights<br>
        you made me realize my friends were all right<br>
        your not as special as I dreamed you up<br>
