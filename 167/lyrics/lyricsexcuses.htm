        and Logan wrote this song about living in a boring town.&nbsp; It tells
        logan's theory about &quot;if your bored, your boring&quot;.&nbsp; It
        describes a situation of a small town with boring people living in
        it.&nbsp; The town isn't what's boring, it's the people who wait for
        stuff to happen.&nbsp; You must make things happen.</font></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial Narrow">everyday i hear the same phrase<br>
        this town sucks, it's so frickin lame<br>
        they all think someday they'll leave<br>
        they all have the same story<br>
        it's so predictable, it pisses me off<br>
        it's so predictable, they're all just talk<br>
        <br>
        don't blame it on your small town<br>
        you gotta blame it on the people around<br>
        don't blame it on where you live<br>
        you gotta blame it on the people in it<br>
        it doesn't matter if we got a mall<br>
        it doesn't matter what we have at all<br>
        it's all about what we do in this small town<br>
        it's all about you, it's what you do<br>
        <br>
        like i always say<br>
        if your bored, your boring <br>
        like i always say<br>
        if your bored, your boring<br>
        <br>
        don't blame it on your small town<br>
        you gotta blame it on the people around<br>
        don't blame it on where you live<br>
        you gotta blame it on the people in it<br>
        <br>
        everyday i hear how boring this town is<br>
        they try to blame it on the ground they stand on<br>
        they try to blame it on the cops<br>
        they try to blame it on the way people walk<br>
        but you can't<br>
        you gotta blame yourselves</font></p>
