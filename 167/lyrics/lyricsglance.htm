        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial Narrow">my life
        was good then you came along<br>
        i knew i had to have you<br>
        many hours spent impressing you<br>
        now they finally paid off<br>
        i'll never forget those days, i spent chasing you<br>
        all the things i used to do<br>
        i got my chance and now your mine<br>
        it all started with a glance, and just another silly dance</font></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial Narrow">my
              life was simple, filled with fun, i had everything i wanted<br>
              perfect as it was<br>
              i didn't know i had it coming, but i guess i saw something in her
              eyes<br>
              i had the goals, i had the girls<br>
              they didn't compare to what i had in store later<br>
              it seemed my life was perfect - then it happened<br>
              you gave me a glance and i lost myself<br>
              in your eyes at that moment i knew i needed you<br>
              and my perfect life was put on hold</font></p>

              along with all the many ups, though there were some downs<br>
              but looking back on it, it was pure ecstasy<br>
              i guess you could say, i knew something else<br>
              i knew in time that you'd be mine </font></p>
