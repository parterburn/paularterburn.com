        don't know why their eyes can't see<br>
        what i think all that i believe<br>
        when i go home, away from my friends<br>
        i sit alone, knowing i'll be here again<br>
        they pretend to care, but i know it's a lie<br>
        the words don't come out, they don't even try<br>
        <br>
        alone like always is how it always ends<br>
        alone like always as if it were a trend<br>
        <br>
        they say I should change and i need to adjust<br>
        all the things i've done is why they can't trust<br>
        i do my best, it's not enough for them<br>
        they don't help in situations i'm in<br>
        they think what they do is all for the good<br>
        as for me i guess i misunderstood</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">i
        leave with their thoughts in my head<br>
        trying to look back on all they said<br>
        away from home, and now they're gone<br>
        what am i to do like this all alone<br>
        i say i'm lost, i said they didn't know<br>
        i try to find myself, but where did I go</span></font></p>
