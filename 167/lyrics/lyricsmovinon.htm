        sunday night wasn't just another playful - that we're known for<br>
        my heart was tied into a million knots, it was ripped and it was torn<br>
        i guess i just can't have these feelings for you i have anymore<br>
        those little things they got to me, the got to you and know we're
        through<br>
        i know it'll be a while before i get over you<br>
        at times you were all i ever had, between the band, my mom, and dad</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">i
        guess after twice i'll realize you broke it off and said we're through<br>
        but will i ever stop chasing after you<br>
        nothing from me changed your mind, those times with you, they were fun<br>
        you were no one, and then my girl, i'm movin on</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">you
        said the words i can't regret the things that i said<br>
        on a break, i asked why and &quot;can we give it another try&quot;<br>
        i guess i never thought it'd end this way<br>
        but i guess i have no say<br>
        all those things, built a wall so high i couldn't crawl<br>
        chasing after you, i hit the wall - what was i suppose to do</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">you
        know i'm sorry for all the things i can be sorry for<br>
        you had the thought for some time, but not the guts you ignored this
        bind<br>
        you couldn't face me when you finally told me it was time to end<br>
        but the next day you talked to me as if nothing ever came</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">you
        told me once, you told me twice - now it's over i've paid the price<br>
        i've chased you back, way too many times<br>
        nothing from me changed your mind<br>
        those times with you, well they're done<br>
        you were no one....<br>
        and then my girl...<br>
        i'm movin on.</span></font></p>
