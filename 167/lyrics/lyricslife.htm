everyone has their bad days<br>
when everything sucks<br>
and your down on your luck<br>

and you think that lifes no fun<br>

this is what you do<br>
<br>
        tomorrows a new day<br>
it doesn't matter anymore<br>
i don't' care, i got me, that's all i need<br>
i don't give a fuck what you think<br>
everyone thinks they understand me<br>
everyone thinks they'll stop me too<br>
        well, well let me tell ya this<br>
        i'm not gonna do anything you want<br>
get outta my way, let me live today<br>
<br>

acting like i don't care<br>
i can't take it anymore</font></p>
